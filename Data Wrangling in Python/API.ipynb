    "A developer actually a created college football data (cfbd) package, which was very convenient.  I just had to spend some time looking over the docs in order to understand the classes and methods available and what I needed to use to get the data that I needed.  The data I'm pulling from the API are the final college football rankings for the 2010-2021 seasons, as those are the seasons that existed in my flat file data source.  Quick summary of my data sources:\n",
    "- Offensive statistics for every college football team from 2010-2021 (flat file)\n",
    "- Defensive statistics for every college football team from 2010-2021 (web scraping)\n",
    "- Top 25 Final Rankings for 2010-2021 (API)\n",
    "So the final dataframe from this data source will be the Top 25 Teams in the final rankings for each season 2010-2021.  I will left join this data on to a combination of the above two data sources, as each of those sources rank every team while this data will only have the Top 25."
